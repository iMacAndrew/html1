			For this Spring, I am going to create a zombie, or monster, survival game, similar to Box Head Zombies. This game will have a top-down third person view, so you will be able to see most of the map. You will start out with only a pistol and will have to survive hordes of zombies. Iâ€™m hoping to add more guns that you can pick up or earn somehow. When you first join the game there will only be a few zombies that will be easy to defeat, but as the game goes on and you survive longer, there will be an increase in the number of zombies and maybe different types of monsters that are harder to kill. Once you clear all the zombies on the map the next set of zombies will spawn in. As a player, you will just see how long you can last and earn a higher score when you kill a zombie or monster. As of now, the end of the game will be when the player dies instead of ending when the player accomplishes something, or reaches a goal.
