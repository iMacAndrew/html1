			Hi, my name is Andrew Humphries, but I mainly go by Andy. I am from the small town Clifton Forge, which is located in Allghany County, Virginia. I have two loving parents and a brother who also attends Radford University. Before coming to Radford University, I attended Dabney S. Lancaster, which is a small community college near me. It was very convenient for me to attend Dabney because I was able to complete all my general education studies and it was relatively close to my home. Since I was able to complete a lot of my classes, I was able to focus up on my programming classes at Radford. As of now, I am Majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Software Engineering. I'm not one hundred percent sure what my plans are as a Software Engineer and pontentially will be changing it in the future. I'm definitely open minded about it all, and will be looking in to it later. One thing that has been catching my eye is Cyber Security. Cyber Security has always kinda fascinated me and to my eye, is the "cool kid" field to go into. I am only just touching the surface of Security, but I am finding it very intriguing.
