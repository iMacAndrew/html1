			I have played soccer for most of my life and have enjoyed every
			second of it! My favorite position is midfield and that is where I played in high school. To me there is no greater feeling than scoring and feeling the rush of adrenaline!

			Video Games have been an interest of mine for a while now. It all started when I first played World of Warcraft. WoW got me interested in other video games which led to me discover League of Legends, Which I have played way too much of, but I am finally bored of it. My "main" games as of now is Counter-Strike Global Offense and H1Z1 King of the Kill. I am a very competitive person and love when games have a competitive online community. CSGO and KOTK is extremely competitive and also has a steep learning curve to them. A player must practice the mechanics of the games to become an above average player. Basically, if a video game is both hard and is difficult to master, it keeps my attention for while.
